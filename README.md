# Introduction to Google Cloud Platform and TensorFlow

This tutorial will introduce you to Google Cloud Compute Engine and TensorFlow. We will go through the basics of tensorflow and implement linear regression, classification and neural networks in tensorflow and run them on Google standalone compute engine. Then, we will submit our model to google cloud which can handle large amounts of data and computational requirement. Often times, Companies buy cloud resources from Goolge or AWS for their Data Science infrastucture instead of buying on-the-premise hardware. We will know how they implement their ML projects using google cloud.
